*Code/Problem Structure*:
- Geometry initialization
- PDE setup
- 

*Problem Definition*:
- Steady state electrothermal analysis of motor
    - constant rotational speed and current amplitude
    - p = 6, Z = 36, m = 3 (same as HF optimization)
    - data-based models for coefficients and parameters
        - linear dependence of resistivity for resistance calculation (copper loss)
        - heat transfer coefficient constant in solids, and dependent on Reynolds number in air-gap (Li et al); same goes for alpha
        - COERCIVITY AND DEMAGNETIZATION EFFECTS FROM TEMPERATURE (need to find)

*Coupling Approach*:
- EM solver runs for given temperature and calculates B-field (NL Poisson-like eq)
- Power losses (heat sources) are calculated with the B-field
- Power losses are fed into steady state heat equation as source terms
    - Source terms act *PER CELL* over the geoemtry (need like a CG0 space)
- Temperature field is calculated based on the heat equation (Poisson eq)
- **CONVERGENCE CRITERIA**:
    - Temperature fields between iteration *k* and *k+1* are the same (norm --> 0)
- Feed temperature distribution back into the initial EM solver
    - New material values based on updated temperature distribution

*TO-DO, NOTES AND COMMENTS*:
- create surrogate model for mu in terms of B and T
    - didn't work; diverges as B gets large outside of the range, which is as expected
    - normal order polynomials can't handle decay, which is why we opted for a custom method for the motor :-(
- create coupled problem for LINEAR PROBLEM
    - CONSTANT PERMEABILITY, RESISTANCE AND SOURCE TERM
    - use as a way to test the mixed problem formulation
- integrate the nonlinear permeability (without temperature)
- introduce source terms
